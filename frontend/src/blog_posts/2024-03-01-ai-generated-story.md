## About This Story

This story was written collaboratively by my mum and me using an [AI Ghost Writer app](/projects/ai-ghost-writer) I built. The premise came from a random conversation we had after my little sister's eye surgery: what if someone started seeing ghosts after receiving an eye transplant?

I wrote the first chapter by hand to establish the voice and style, then used GPT-3.5 Turbo to generate subsequent chapters based on our plot ideas. My mum contributed increasingly creative plot directions involving mysterious figures and international intrigue. We got about 8 chapters in before the context window limitations made it difficult to maintain coherence.

It's an interesting experiment in human-AI collaborative fiction. Enjoy!

## Chapter 1: Under the Knife

Lila studied her face carefully. It was probably be the last time she would look at her face with her eyes like this. Her dark brown eyes almost matched the colour of her short hair. The freckles on her cheeks and nose were particularly prominent at the moment. Her slightly aquiline features increasingly reminded her of her father. She smiled at the thought.

She looked down at her hospital gown. It was her first time wearing one of these. They were surprisingly comfortable, aside from the cool air down her back and legs. Compression socks tightly squeezed her calves.

How long did they say she would be in recovery for? A week? A shiver ran down her spine and she felt momentarily apprehensive. Hopefully Reggie would behave himself while Michael was looking after him. Michael had looked after her dog on occasion before but this would be the longest yet. Actually, this would be the longest time Lila and Reggie would be apart since she had adopted him from the rescue shelter. She missed him already.

A knock suddenly erupted at the door and the Nurse Joy burst in. 'Alright are you all dressed and ready? Time to head to the theatres now.' She smiled through her medical mask while donning surgical gloves. She swiftly scanned Lila's attire, as Lila gathered her belongings 'I guess I'm ready'.

Dr Patel leant down, her eyes staring intently into Lila's, studying them like clinicians do. 'Yes I see the problem. It's progressed very quickly for someone your age. You are very lucky that we got a donor so quickly. People often wait several years to get a compatible donor. Corneas need very specific conditions to be preserved for transplantation. We need to ensure the donor...' The doctor mumbled to herself and busily prepared her equipment. Lila took in a deep breath, starting to feel an anxious ball in the pit of her stomach.

She didn't feel very lucky to have to have this surgery at all. It was only a couple of weeks ago when it was determined that she would lose her eyesight permanently unless she had this surgery. Even with the surgery, they had explained to her more times than she could count that there are risks. The success rate was only 60%. So after all this fuss, there was a considerable chance she could still go blind?

The nurse shuffled towards her, juggling chords and tubes, guiding a face mask towards Lila's face. 'We are going to put you under now. Don't worry, you won't feel a thing just breathe normally and count to 10'. The nurse fiddled around fitting the face mask over her face. Lila closed her eyes and counted, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7...

## Chapter 2: Recovery

Lila slowly opened her eyes, blinking against the harsh light in the hospital room. Nurse Joy stood beside her, a warm smile on her face. 'Welcome back, Lila. How are you feeling?' she asked gently.

Lila's vision was blurry, and she winced at the sharp pain in her eyes. Her head throbbed as she tried to focus, shapes and colors began to form around her. 'It's... it's pretty blurry,' she muttered, her voice rough from the anesthesia.

The doctor entered the room, her presence authoritative yet comforting. 'Good morning, Lila. I'm pleased to inform you that the surgery went exceptionally well. Your new cornea is well attached, and if all continues to progress positively, you should be able to head home in a few days,' Dr. Patel explained with a warm smile, a hint of pride in her voice.

Relief flooded through Lila, her disorientation abating slightly. The thought of going home, of snuggling Reggie and hugging Michael, filled her heart with warmth.

'I must inform you, Lila, that some patients have reported experiencing hallucinations and seeing things that aren't real after this type of surgery. It's a rare side effect, but I want to prepare you in case it happens. These visions should fade within 3 to 6 months as your brain adjusts to the new visual input,' Dr. Patel cautioned gently. 'Alright, now get some rest, get lots of sleep and fluids and don't push yourself.'

A few days later, back in the familial comfort of her own home, Lila prepared to take Reggie for a walk. Her vision was still a little blurry, but it was improving with every passing day. It was probably already even better than it was before the surgery. Reggie was so happy to have her home. He had almost not left her side since she had arrived. He wagged his tail expectantly, his leash jiggling wildly in her hands. 'Ok buddy, let's go then.'

As she passed the mirror, something peculiar caught her eye. A figure, a woman with long flowing hair and piercing deep blue eyes, stared back at her for a split second. Startled, Lila turned back to the mirror, her familiar face staring back at her. She shook her head, chiding herself, cursing her poor eyesight. It must have been a trick of the light, a remnant of her medication-induced dreams.

With a deep breath, she opened the front door and stepped out to the quiet street in her quaint neighbourhood.

## Chapter 3: Work Life

Lila adjusted the stack of books in her arms, feeling the familiar weight as she moved through the aisles of the library. The scent of old pages and new books intermingled in the air, comforting her as she settled back into the routine of her librarian duties. The surgery seemed like a distant memory now, and she was grateful for the normalcy of her surroundings.

As she organized the mystery novels, her thoughts drifted back to the first time she had stepped into a library, a young girl with big dreams inspired by the worlds hidden within the pages of countless books. Being a librarian had been her way of giving back and sharing the magic of storytelling with others, even if the initial excitement had waned over the years. Well, it's not like an English Literature major has a plethora of employment opportunities to choose from.

A familiar voice broke through her reverie, and Lila looked up to see Josie, her close friend and colleague, walking towards her with a smile. 'Hey, Lila, there you are! Michael was looking for you. I think he's out the front,' Josie informed her, juggling an unreasonable number of books in her arms. 'Thanks, let me give you a hand with that before you hurt yourself.'

Lila made her way to the front desk where Michael was hunched over in an armchair, poring over a stack of case files. Not dissimilar to how he looked when they first met over a year ago now. His work often brought him to the library where they stored historical local news articles. His focus shifted to Lila as she approached, a warm smile lighting up his handsome features.

'Lila, I've been looking for you,' Michael greeted, his eyes soft with affection. 'I was wondering if you're free for dinner tonight. We just wrapped up a big case so I should be able to get off in time to do something for once.'

Surprised by the sudden invitation, Lila's heart fluttered with anticipation. 'I'm free,' she replied, a mix of curiosity and excitement bubbling within her. 'I actually wanted to take you out for dinner to thank you for looking after Reggie while I was in the hospital.'

Michael's smile widened, a glint of appreciation in his eyes. 'That sounds lovely, Lila. Dinner tonight it is then. It's a date,' he said, his voice filled with warmth and something more that Lila couldn't quite decipher.

## Chapter 4: Dinner and Dream

The aroma of sizzling meat and savory spices filled the air as Lila and Michael sat at a table in the cozy Korean BBQ restaurant. Usually, Michael would be enjoying his meal with gusto, but tonight, there was a heaviness in his expression that Lila couldn't ignore. She studied him for a moment, his usual vibrancy replaced by a contemplative silence.

'Michael, is everything okay?' Lila finally inquired, concern lacing her voice. Michael's gaze flickered towards her, a fleeting moment of vulnerability before his usual cop facade slid back into place. 'It's just work, Lila. You know I can't discuss it with you,' he replied, a hint of frustration underlying his words.

Lila nodded, a little deflated by the terse manner with which he dismissed her concern. However, curiosity prompted her to inqiure further. 'Well you can tell me what kind of case it is right? Is it another homicide?' she probed, hoping to alleviate some of his burden by lending an ear.

Michael hesitated, his jaw tightening imperceptibly before he relented, 'Officially, it's a missing persons case. But something about it... my experience is telling me it's something more complex, than it appears on the surface.'

Concern etched lines on Lila's forehead as she absorbed his words. She had seen the toll Michael's cases took on him and how he carried the weight of the world on his shoulders. 'I wish I could help, even in the smallest way,' she murmured, her hand reaching out to touch his in a gesture of support.

Michael managed a small, grateful smile, squeezing her hand briefly before changing the subject. 'Let's talk about something else, yeah? It's my first night off in weeks, I want to enjoy it with you,' he said, mustering a genuine smile for her sake. 'So tell me more about your fun outings with Reggie. I'm so glad you two get along!'. Michael's eyes lightened as he reflected on his few days with Reggie.

The pungent aroma of Korean BBQ still lingered in Lila's senses as she drifted off to sleep that night. The events of the day settled in her mind. But as she slipped into the realms of dreams, the familiar scent gave way to an exotic fragrance, transporting her to a place she couldn't quite pinpoint.

She found herself standing in a luxurious apartment, the panoramic view of a city by the water sprawling before her. The unfamiliar surroundings made her heart race with a mix of anticipation and uncertainty. Was this a dream or a memory she had long forgotten?

The sound of a man's voice drew her attention to the bedroom. He spoke in a language foreign to her ears, a melodic cadence that hinted at Portuguese perhaps? She heard him pace the room, his voice carried notes of desperation and fear. Lila strained to understand his words but could only grasp the urgency in his tone 'Adeus! Adeus! Ore por mim.'

He suddenly stormed out of the bedroom. 'We need to leave the country as soon as we can. It's not safe here. Are you packed? We need to go. NOW.' the man said, his eyes reflecting a deep sense of panic. Questions swirled in her mind, confusion clouding her thoughts as she tried to make sense of the situation.

With a firm grip on her hand, the man ushered her towards the door, his actions decisive yet shrouded in mystery. Lila's pulse quickened as she glanced back at the apartment, her eyes falling on a mirror that held a startling revelation. The reflection staring back at her was not her own—it was a woman with long blonde hair and piercing blue eyes.

## Chapter 5: Walk

Lila woke with a start. The morning sunlight filtered through the curtains, casting a warm glow across Lila's room. She blinked away the remnants of her dream, the image of the blonde woman's face still lingering in the corners of her mind. Trying to shake off the unease, she sat up, it was just a dream.

As she swung her legs off the bed, her gaze fell on the note on the bedside table. Michael's messy handwriting spelled out a simple 'Good morning, had to dash, didn't want to wake you. Love you.' A surge of warmth enveloped her, grateful for his thoughtfulness even in his absence.

Reggie sauntered into the room, his tail wagging tentatively as if sensing her disquiet. Lila knelt down, scratching behind his ears. 'It's just me being silly, boy. Don't worry about it,' she murmured, mustering a reassuring smile for her furry companion.

After a quick breakfast, they set out for their morning walk. The gentle breeze played with Lila's hair, the sunshine kissing her skin with a comforting warmth. The vibrant chatter of birds filled the air, creating a soothing backdrop to their stroll. Going for a walk always helped clear her mind when she felt uneasy.

Making their way towards the dog park, Lila turned the corner, and a flash of movement caught her eye. A woman with long blonde hair stood at the end of the street, her intense gaze fixed on Lila before she disappeared around the corner. Lila froze, her heart pounding in her chest. It couldn't be the woman from the dream, right?

Lila quickened her pace, determined to catch up with the mysterious woman. Reggie, sensing her urgency, bounded alongside her, his steps mirroring her own. Turning into the side street, Lila's eyes widened in surprise as she found it empty, the woman nowhere in sight.

Confusion clouded her thoughts as she scanned the quiet surroundings. Was it a trick of the light? A figment of her imagination?

Brushing off her paranoia, Lila chuckled at her own unease, chastising herself for letting her thoughts run wild. She glanced down at Reggie, who sat by her side, his gaze fixed on the empty street, a low growl rumbling in his throat. 'It's okay, Reggie. Let's continue our walk,' she reassured him, though a shiver danced down her spine.

As they resumed their stroll, Lila couldn't shake off the feeling of being watched, of unseen eyes following her every move. A sense of unease lingered in the back of her mind, a puzzle waiting to be unraveled.

## Chapter 6: Michael and Arun

Michael sat at his cluttered desk, the flickering light from his old computer casting a dim glow over the messy office. The air stale with old cigarettes, used coffee mugs and leftover takeout, a testament to the countless hours spent immersed in solving cases. He shuffled through the disarray of files, the chaos reflecting the whirlwind of his thoughts.

Michael meticulously rearranged the documents from the case file, his mind was consumed with the details of the missing person's case they had been working on. The young man had vanished without a trace, his wife was found in their home in a comatose state and hospitalised. They were new to the area, had only been living there a month or two. The pieces of the puzzle seemed scattered, and Michael's frustration grew as he tried to make sense of it all.

The door jerked open, and Arun strolled in, 'Morning Mike, sorry I'm late again, had to drop the girls off to school this morning. Kim had physio and her mother was around again for dinner...', the clock had just ticked 8:45am. Michael grunted in response without looking up from his files, deeply lost in thought as he often was.

'So how was dinner with Lila?' Arun inquired, his warm demeanor brightening the atmosphere of the office. Michael smiled but gave a noncommittal response, his mind preoccupied with the complexities of their current case. That was probably the most Arun was going to get from him this morning. Michael was always like this when he was on a case. Which was almost always. Arun worried for Michael sometimes, this was Michaels first long term relationship, and he was sure that he could not do much better. He was going to have to force Michael to stop working and spend time with Lila if this relationship was going to last.

Michael sighed deeply 'I keep going over the details in this case and it just doesn't make any sense! I don't get why this guy just left his wife and she ' steered the conversation towards the current case. The missing person whose trail had led them to a dead end. Just as they delved into the details, a shrill ring echoed through the office, signaling an incoming call.

With a shared glance, Arun answered the call, his brows furrowed and a grave expression on his face. Calls out of nowhere hardly ever brought good news. He sat down, listening intently to the information being relayed. The gruff voice of an officer in a neighbouring suburb relayed the discovery of a body matching the description of their missing man. It was a breakthrough they had been waiting for, yet the implications weighed heavy on their shoulders.

As they gathered their essentials and prepared to head to the neighboring town, a sense of determination set in. The case had taken a new turn, a path fraught with unanswered questions and unforeseen dangers. Michael's focus sharpened, his mind already racing ahead to the next steps in unraveling the mystery that lay before them.

Things were about to get more complicated.
