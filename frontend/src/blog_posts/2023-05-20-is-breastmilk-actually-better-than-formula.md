## What does the research say?

### [Review of Infant Feeding: Key Features of Breast Milk and Infant Formula](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4882692/?fbclid=IwAR0n9zJYLNvwngaYYhjTBkgYU9m5XAnzQOOCwt0t-yE11Jhe8w6z4dLZhzU)

Mothers' own milk is the best source of nutrition for nearly all infants. Beyond somatic growth, breast milk as a biologic fluid has a variety of other benefits, including modulation of postnatal intestinal function, immune ontogeny, and brain development. Although breastfeeding is highly recommended, breastfeeding may not always be possible, suitable or solely adequate. Infant formula is an industrially produced substitute for infant consumption. Infant formula attempts to mimic the nutritional composition of breast milk as closely as possible, and is based on cow's milk or soymilk. A number of alternatives to cow's milk-based formula also exist. In this article, we review the nutritional information of breast milk and infant formulas for better understanding of the importance of breastfeeding and the uses of infant formula from birth to 12 months of age when a substitute form of nutrition is required.

### [Breastfeeding in the 21st century: epidemiology, mechanisms, and lifelong effect](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(15)01024-7/fulltext)

Our meta-analyses indicate protection against child infections and malocclusion, increases in intelligence, and probable reductions in overweight and diabetes. We did not find associations with allergic disorders such as asthma or with blood pressure or cholesterol, and we noted an increase in tooth decay with longer periods of breastfeeding. For nursing women, breastfeeding gave protection against breast cancer and it improved birth spacing, and it might also protect against ovarian cancer and type 2 diabetes. The scaling up of breastfeeding to a near universal level could prevent 823,000 annual deaths in children younger than 5 years and 20,000 annual deaths from breast cancer. Recent epidemiological and biological findings from during the past decade expand on the known benefits of breastfeeding for women and children, whether they are rich or poor.

### [Differences in morbidity between breast-fed and formula-fed infants](https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(95)70395-0/fulltext)

In the first year of life the incidence of diarrheal illness among BF infants was half that of FF infants; the percentage with any otitis media was 19% lower and with prolonged episodes (>10 days) was 80% lower in BF compared with FF infants.

### [Breast feeding and lower respiratory tract illness in the first year of life](https://www.bmj.com/content/299/6705/946)

Breast feeding seems to protect against wheezing respiratory tract illnesses in the first four months of life, particularly when other risk factors are present.

### [Feeding Strategies for Premature Infants: Beneficial Outcomes of Feeding Fortified Human Milk Versus Preterm Formula](https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/103/6/1150/62255/Feeding-Strategies-for-Premature-Infants?redirectedFrom=fulltext)

Although the study does not allow a comparison of FHM (fortified human milk) with unfortified human milk, the data suggest that the unique properties of human milk promote an improved host defense and gastrointestinal function compared with the feeding of formula. The benefits of improved health (less sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis) associated with the feeding of FHM outweighed the slower rate of growth observed, suggesting that the feeding of FHM should be promoted actively in premature infants.

### [Maternal Sense of Control During Childbirth and Infant Feeding Method](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32028504/)

Results: Of 5,185 women, 32.9% (n=1,705) were exclusively breastfeeding, 31.2% (n=1,620) were breastfeeding and formula feeding, and 35.9% (n=1,860) were exclusively formula feeding 4-8 weeks after delivery. Overall Labor Agentry Scale score ranged from 34 to 203 (median 167, interquartile range 145-182). The median Labor Agentry Scale score was 169 (interquartile range 151-183) for women exclusively breastfeeding, 166 (interquartile range 142-182) for women who were breastfeeding and formula feeding, and 164 (interquartile range 142-181) for women who were only formula feeding (P<.001). In the unadjusted multinomial model, women with Labor Agentry Scale scores in the lowest two quintiles (ie, those with lower perceived control during childbirth) were less likely to be exclusively breastfeeding (as compared with those exclusively formula feeding) than women in the highest Labor Agentry Scale quintile. When controlling for confounders, however, this association was no longer significant.

After adjustment for confounders, perceived control during childbirth was not associated with breastfeeding at 4-8 weeks postpartum among nulliparous women.

## When do people typically stop breastfeeding?

**Conclusion:** Don't start weaning until 6 months for a healthier more intelligent baby.

### [The Association Between Duration of Breastfeeding and Adult Intelligence](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/194901)

Duration of breastfeeding was associated with significantly higher scores on the Verbal, Performance, and Full Scale WAIS IQs. With regression adjustment for potential confounding factors, the mean Full Scale WAIS IQs were 99.4, 101.7, 102.3, 106.0, and 104.0 for breastfeeding durations of less than 1 month, 2 to 3 months, 4 to 6 months, 7 to 9 months, and more than 9 months, respectively (P = .003 for overall F test). The corresponding mean scores on the BPP were 38.0, 39.2, 39.9, 40.1, and 40.1 (P = .01 for overall F test).

Independent of a wide range of possible confounding factors, a significant positive association between duration of breastfeeding and intelligence was observed in 2 independent samples of young adults, assessed with 2 different intelligence tests.

A number of studies have suggested a positive association between breastfeeding and cognitive and intellectual development in early and middle childhood. However, studies of correlations between childhood and adult intelligence show that intelligence is quite unstable during the first decade of life, particularly in early childhood. Consequently, it is possible that exclusively or predominantly bottlefed children may catch up and ultimately achieve the same intelligence level as children who were breastfed.

### [Breastfeeding practices and associations with pregnancy, maternal and infant characteristics in Australia](https://internationalbreastfeedingjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13006-023-00545-5)

Exclusive breastfeeding to six months of age is a major global public health priority. Several characteristics are known to be associated with early cessation of breastfeeding, however, limited evidence exists regarding whether women's reported reasons for cessation are associated with maternal, pregnancy and infant characteristics. The aims of this study were to: i) describe women's reported intention to breastfeed and their subsequent breastfeeding practices; ii) describe women's reported reasons for breastfeeding cessation prior to the infant being five months of age; and iii) examine associations between these factors and maternal, pregnancy and infant characteristics.

The majority of women intended to (94%), and did, initiate (95%) breastfeeding. At the time the survey was conducted, 57% of women were exclusively breastfeeding. Women who: had less than University level education, had a pre-pregnancy BMI in the overweight or obese category, and who smoked tobacco at the time of the survey had lower odds of exclusively breastfeeding. The most common self-reported reasons for breastfeeding cessation were breastfeeding challenges (47%) and low milk supply (40%). Women aged 26-35 years and 36+ years had greater odds of reporting breastfeeding cessation due to low milk supply (OR=2.92, 95% CI: 1.11, 7.66; OR=5.57, 95% CI: 1.70, 18.29) compared to women aged 18-25 years. While women who had completed a TAFE certificate or diploma had lower odds of reporting this as a reason for breastfeeding cessation (OR=0.28; 95% CI: 0.11, 0.73) compared to women who had University level education. There were no other significant associations found between characteristics and reasons for ceasing breastfeeding.

Of the mothers who intended to breastfeed up to 6 months, only 50.72% were still breastfeeding at 6 months after birth, compared to 89.58% of mothers who had intended to breastfeed for 7 to 12 months and 94.30% of mothers who had intended to breastfeed for more than 12 months. There was a positive correlation between maternal postpartum intention to breastfeed and actual breastfeeding duration (Pearson contingency coefficient=0.42; P<0.05)

### [Calcium, zinc, and vitamin D in breast milk: a systematic review and meta-analysis](https://internationalbreastfeedingjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13006-023-00564-2)

Breast milk is a major component of the diet and an important source of nutrient intake in infants and young children. Exclusive breastfeeding up to 6 months of age is recommended, followed by continued breastfeeding up to two years or beyond. Breast milk from healthy well-nourished women is expected to provide adequate amounts and concentrations of the majority of nutrients for optimal growth of infants. Based on this assumption, breast milk content in most nutrients can be used to estimate requirements in infants up to 6 months of age and children up to 3 years of age.
