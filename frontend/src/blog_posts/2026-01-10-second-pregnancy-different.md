I'm currently pregnant with baby #2, and let me tell you: everything is different this time around.

## First Pregnancy: The Research Project

First time around, I treated pregnancy like a research project. I read ALL the books. I had a spreadsheet for nursery purchases. I optimized everything.

I knew exactly how many weeks pregnant I was at any given moment. I tracked every symptom. I had a birth plan that was basically a technical specification document.

## Second Pregnancy: Survival Mode

This time? I regularly forget how many weeks pregnant I am. I have to do mental math to figure it out.

The nursery will be "toddler's room with a bassinet shoved in."

Birth plan? "Get baby out safely." That's it. That's the whole plan.

## Chasing a Toddler While Exhausted

First trimester exhaustion + active 2-year-old = a new circle of hell.

First pregnancy, I could nap whenever I was tired. Now? My toddler does not care that I'm growing a human. She wants me to read "The Very Hungry Caterpillar" for the 47th time today.

Also, picking up a toddler when you're pregnant is a workout. My back is already complaining and I'm only in second trimester.

## Work is... Complicated

First pregnancy, I could power through the fatigue with coffee (well, limited coffee) and sheer will.

This time, I'm running on fumes while trying to:
- Debug production ML models
- Attend meetings
- Pretend I'm not about to fall asleep at my desk
- Deal with toddler sick days

The combination of pregnancy brain + toddler sleep deprivation + debugging complex systems is... challenging.

## The Emotional Difference

First time: Excitement! Wonder! Every milestone felt magical!

Second time: Still exciting, but also: "Wait, I have to do sleep deprivation AGAIN?"

But here's the thing—I also have perspective now. I know the newborn phase is temporary. I know I'll survive the sleep deprivation (barely, but still). I know it gets easier AND harder in different ways.

## What's Better This Time

I'm not sweating the small stuff. Baby will sleep where baby sleeps. We'll figure it out.

I'm not buying all the gadgets. We learned what we actually used last time (spoiler: not much).

I'm asking for help without guilt. I have a toddler, a full-time job, and I'm growing a human. It's okay to need support.

## The Beautiful Part

Watching my daughter pat my belly and say "baby" melts my heart.

Knowing she'll have a sibling, a built-in friend, makes all the chaos worth it.

And honestly? As hard as this is, I'm grateful I get to do it. Not everyone gets this experience, and I don't take it for granted.

## To Other Second-Time Mums in Tech

You're not failing because you're not "optimizing" this pregnancy.
You're not less excited just because you're more realistic.
You're not a bad employee because you're tired.
You're doing something incredibly hard, and you're doing it beautifully.

We've got this. (Most days. Probably.) 💪🤰
