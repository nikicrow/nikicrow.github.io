Content warning: This post discusses breastfeeding and pumping in detail. If that makes you uncomfortable, this might not be the post for you.

Still here? Good. Let's talk about something that affects millions of working mums but rarely gets discussed in tech: pumping at work.

## The Reality

I returned to work when my daughter was 4 months old. I was determined to continue breastfeeding, which meant pumping 3x per day at work.

Here's what that actually looked like:

**7am**: Feed baby before leaving
**10am**: Pump (20 minutes + setup/cleanup)
**1pm**: Pump (20 minutes + setup/cleanup)
**4pm**: Pump (20 minutes + setup/cleanup)
**6pm**: Feed baby when home

That's ~90 minutes of your workday just... not working. Not to mention the mental load of scheduling it around meetings.

## The Logistical Nightmare

**Finding a space**: I was lucky—my office had a dedicated lactation room. But it was ALWAYS booked. I've pumped in bathroom stalls (not ideal), empty conference rooms (awkward when someone walks in), and once, desperately, in my car.

**Scheduling around meetings**: "Sorry, can we move the 1pm? That's my pump time." You say it once, it's fine. You say it every week, you feel like you're being difficult.

**Storing milk**: Our office fridge had a "lactation section." Which meant my milk sat next to someone's leftover curry. Cool cool cool.

## The Technical Challenges

Yes, I'm calling them technical challenges.

**Hands-free pumping while coding**: I bought a hands-free pumping bra specifically so I could keep working. I've written some of my best code while pumping.

**Video calls while pumping**: Strategic camera angles and "I'm camera-off today" became my friends.

**The mental context-switch**: You're deep in debugging, then alarm goes off, and you have to physically stop and pump. Then try to get back into flow state.

## What Made It Easier

**Supportive team**: My manager explicitly said "pumping time is work time." That permission to not feel guilty was huge.

**Block it on calendar**: I blocked "Personal" time. Everyone knew what it meant, no one questioned it.

**Having backup supplies**: Extra pump parts at work saved me multiple times.

**Lowering expectations**: I wasn't as productive during those months. That's okay.

## What Would Have Made It Better

**More and better spaces**: One lactation room for a 200-person office isn't enough.

**Less stigma**: I shouldn't have to whisper "pumping" like it's a dirty word.

**Flexibility**: Some days I needed to pump at 10:30, not 10:00. Rigid schedules don't work with biology.

## Why This Matters

About 80% of new mums start breastfeeding. Many want to continue when they return to work. But the lack of support means many stop earlier than they wanted.

We talk about diversity in tech. We talk about retention of women. But if we don't support the practical realities of being a working mum, we're going to keep losing talented women from the industry.

## To Other Pumping Mums

Block that time. Don't apologize for it. Your body is doing something amazing.

If someone makes you feel bad about it, that's their problem, not yours.

And if you decide to stop? That's okay too. Fed is best, and your mental health matters.

## To Everyone Else

If a colleague says they need to pump, just say "of course" and move on. Don't make it weird.

If you're in leadership, push for better lactation facilities.

If you're in a meeting and someone says they need to step out, don't make them explain why.

We normalize coffee breaks. We can normalize feeding breaks too.
