I'm writing this from my desk, 25 weeks pregnant, after forgetting what I was going to say mid-sentence in a meeting. Again.

Let's talk about what working while pregnant in tech actually looks like.

## First Trimester: The Secret Keeping

You're not "supposed" to tell anyone until 12 weeks. Which means you're:

- Leaving meetings to throw up (while claiming it's food poisoning)
- Falling asleep at your desk (while claiming you had a late night)
- Declining happy hour (while making up increasingly ridiculous excuses)

The secrecy adds a layer of stress to an already exhausting time. And if you're having a rough pregnancy? You're suffering in silence while everyone wonders why your performance is off.

## Pregnancy Brain is REAL

"Pregnancy brain" sounds like a cute joke until you:

- Forget what variable you just named (while writing code)
- Lose your train of thought mid-standup
- Can't remember if you already pushed that commit
- Walk into a room and have no idea why you're there

I now take twice as many notes as before. My code reviews take longer because I have to really concentrate. I triple-check everything.

## The Physical Challenges

**Sitting**: After a certain point, sitting at a desk for 8 hours is uncomfortable. My setup that worked great pre-pregnancy? Needs constant adjustment now.

**Standing**: Standing desks are great until your back and feet start hurting after 20 minutes.

**Fatigue**: Some days I'm fine. Some days I'm so tired I could cry. The unpredictability is the hard part.

**Bathroom breaks**: I now know the location of every bathroom near every meeting room. I've excused myself from calls more times than I can count.

## The Mental Load

Beyond the physical pregnancy, there's:

- Doctor appointments (during work hours)
- Preparing for maternity leave
- Worrying about leave timing
- Dealing with everyone's opinions about everything
- Trying to prove you're still competent despite the limitations

## What Would Actually Help

**Flexibility**: Some days I need to start late or finish early. Flexibility makes everything easier.

**Grace**: If I'm quieter in meetings or need things repeated, it's not because I don't care. My brain is literally growing another human.

**Better leave policies**: The fact that I'm stressed about leave timing and job security while pregnant is absurd.

**Normalize it**: Pregnancy isn't a shameful secret. Let's stop treating it like one.

## To Pregnant People in Tech

You're not imagining it—this IS hard.
You're not failing—you're doing two full-time jobs.
You're not being dramatic—your body is doing something intense.

Take the break. Ask for accommodations. Protect your peace.

## To Managers and Colleagues

Ask "what do you need?" and then actually provide it.
Don't assume pregnancy = incompetence.
Flexible schedules aren't a favor—they're a necessity.
And please stop asking if we're "excited." Sometimes we're just tired.

This is hard, but we're doing it. And that's worth acknowledging.
