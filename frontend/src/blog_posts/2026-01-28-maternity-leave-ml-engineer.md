I'm currently pregnant with my second and gearing up for another round of maternity leave. The first time around, I had so many fears that, looking back, seem almost comical. But they were very real at the time.

## The Fear of Becoming "Obsolete"

Tech moves fast. ML moves faster. I was convinced that taking 6 months off meant I'd return to a world where transformers were old news and everyone had moved on to something I'd never heard of.

Reality check: Yes, new papers come out constantly. Yes, frameworks evolve. But the fundamentals don't change that quickly. And honestly? Most production ML isn't using the bleeding edge anyway.

When I came back, I spent a weekend reading about what I'd missed, and I was caught up. The skills that matter most—problem formulation, data engineering, production debugging—those didn't go anywhere.

## Your Team Will Survive (And So Will Your Projects)

I had intricate handover docs. I had backup plans for my backup plans. I was SO worried about my projects falling apart.

They didn't. Your team is more capable than you think. And if your projects truly can't survive without you for a few months, that's a different problem entirely.

## The Guilt is Real (And Mostly Pointless)

Guilt about leaving work. Guilt about thinking about work. Guilt about not being productive. Guilt about enjoying time with your baby when you "should" be keeping up with papers.

Here's what helped me: I wasn't "on leave from my career." I was literally growing and caring for a human. That's not nothing. That's not less important than shipping code.

## What I Wish I'd Done Differently

**Set clearer boundaries**: First time around, I still checked Slack. I still responded to "urgent" questions. This time? I'm logging out completely.

**Trusted my brain more**: I was worried about "losing" technical skills. But your brain doesn't unlearn Python in 6 months. You're not starting from zero.

**Prepared financially better**: Having a cushion reduces SO much stress. We saved aggressively before my first leave and it made everything easier.

## What I'm Doing This Time

- Complete Slack/email blackout (emergency contact via phone only)
- Pre-scheduling some blog posts so I feel connected on my terms
- Having a "return to work" plan that includes ramping up slowly
- Letting go of FOMO about conferences, launches, or "the next big thing"

## The Bottom Line

Maternity leave in tech comes with unique anxieties, especially in fast-moving fields like ML. But you're not going to become obsolete. Your skills will still be there. Your career will recover.

And honestly? Stepping away gave me perspective that made me better at my job when I returned. I came back with clearer priorities and less tolerance for busywork.

You've got this. 💪
