_This is Part 3 of a 6-part series on principals that scale well. Read [Part 1: Introduction](/blog/principals-that-scale-intro) first._

# Principal 2: The written word

This section refers to two different ways you can scale that both involve writing things down.

## 2.1 Solid documentation

People think documentation is for weirdos with too much time. Not so!

Great, detailed, beginner friendly documentation, particularly how to guides on processes or how to follow a system are great for so many reasons:

1. **They help get your thoughts neat and orderly on how to do something.** It's not uncommon for me to find an optimisation that I never would have seen without trying to document the process.

2. **They exist so if you forget, you can refer to them yourself** (let's be real, I am almost always just writing docs for myself).

3. **When somebody asks you how to do something, instead of jumping on a call for 30 mins, you just send the docs** - that 30 mins is time back in your day :)

4. **They mean everyone is following a consistent way of doing the thing.** Often you can do something in many ways and the more ways people do things, the messier things get.

5. **You are leaving a paper trail so you know what you worked on when and when you finished it.** It doesn't sound relevant, but how many projects have you left no trace of?

What I define as 'solid' documentation is really dependent on what it is. For example, if we are documenting a cumbersome process that we only do once a quarter or so and therefore will forget it by the next time we do it, we want detailed simple instructions with LOTS of screenshots. Say what button is next, explain the outputs you expect if it worked, if it is relevant even explain why you need to do something that way. If you are creating a template, make it really obvious what needs to be filled in, leave a guide at the top of the page on how to go about filling it, be clear on what you are expecting by providing pre-filled examples. If you are documenting a process, add links, emojis, make it interesting, even add hidden easter eggs.

Solid documentation is documentation that people will go back to after a long time and understand without having to reach out to you.

## 2.2 Async communication

What is async communication? It's any form of communicating that isn't done in a meeting basically. Like messaging, emailing or even PR reviews.

It should be obvious why this scales. You only have 8 hours in a work day, 24 hours in a day. Jumping into a meeting to go into details on something that could have been an email or a well presented document is not scalable or sustainable.

If it's going to be a lot of content, then help people understand how to approach your docs, but don't go into the weeds and expect people to listen.

### Keeping everyone in the loop

The other way I have seen this scale well is to keep everyone relevant in the loop. Create a channel and post updates in it. This helps with:

1. **Observability** - Look and see that I am in fact doing what I am meant to be doing in a reasonable amount of time

2. **Context setting for future issues that may arise** - I did alert you to the possibility of this situation becoming quite dire several times, and now we are all here and unsurprised

3. **Covering yourself by leaving a paper trail** - I always like to leave a paper trail to hedge myself for future issues

4. **Updating lots of people at once** - The more people you need to talk to, the further out you need to plan a meeting, not so with async communication, they will read it in a small pocket of time they find and this will be a different pocket to the other bunch of people who needed to know

## Conclusion

Now I hope it's clear that WRITING THINGS DOWN where people read them is very scalable. I definitely prefer this to 'Hey do you have 5 minutes for a call?' (even though I often do that). Not really, and now I feel anxious that you are calling me to tell me I did something bad. Documentation has also really saved me so much time and has given me reassurance when I forget things.
