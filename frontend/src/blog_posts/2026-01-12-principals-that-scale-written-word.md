*This is Part 3 of a 6-part series on principals that scale well. Read [Part 1: Introduction](/blog/principals-that-scale-intro) first.*

# Principal 2: The written word

This section refers to two different ways you can scale that both involve writing things down.

## 2.1 Solid documentation

People think documentation is for weirdos with too much time. Not so!

Great, detailed, beginner friendly documentation, particularly how to guides on processes or how to follow a system are great for so many reasons:

1. **They help get your thoughts neat and orderly on how to do something.** It's not uncommon for me to find an optimisation that I never would have seen without trying to document the process.

2. **They exist so if you forget, you can refer to them yourself** (let's be real, I am almost always just writing docs for myself).

3. **When somebody asks you how to do something, instead of jumping on a call for 30 mins, you just send the docs** - that 30 mins is time back in your day :)

4. **They mean everyone is following a consistent way of doing the thing.** Often you can do something in many ways and the more ways people do things, the messier things get.

5. **You are leaving a paper trail so you know what you worked on when and when you finished it.** It doesn't sound relevant, but how many projects have you left no trace for?

## 2.2 Async communication

What is async communication? It's any form of communicating that isn't done in a meeting basically. Like messaging, emailing or even PR reviews.

It should be obvious why this scales. You only have 8 hours in a work day, 24 hours in a day. Jumping into a meeting to go into details on something that could have been an email or a well presented document is not scalable or sustainable.

If it's going to be a lot of content, then help people understand how to approach your docs, but don't go into the weeds and expect people to listen.

### Keeping everyone in the loop

The other way I have seen this scale well is to keep everyone relevant in the loop. Create a channel and post updates in it. This helps with:

1. **Observability** - Look and see that I am in fact doing what I am meant to be doing in a reasonable amount of time

2. **Context setting for future issues that may arise** - I did alert you to the possibility of this situation becoming quite dire several times, and now we are all here and unsurprised

3. **Covering yourself by leaving a paper trail** - I always like to leave a paper trail to hedge myself for future issues

4. **Updating lots of people at once** - The more people you need to talk to, the further out you need to plan a meeting, not so with async communication, they will read it in a small pocket of time they find and this will be a different pocket to the other bunch of people who needed to know
