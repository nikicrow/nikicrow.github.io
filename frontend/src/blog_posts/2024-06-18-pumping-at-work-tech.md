Still here? Good. Let's talk about something that affects millions of working mums but rarely gets discussed in tech: pumping at work.

## The Reality

I returned to work when my daughter was 5 months old. I was determined to continue breastfeeding, which meant pumping 2x per day at work at first.

Here's what that actually looked like:

**7am**: Feed baby before leaving
**11am**: Pump (30 minutes + 5 minutes setup + 15 minutes cleanup - need to sterilise and dry)
**2pm**: Pump (30 minutes + 5 minutes setup + 5 minutes cleanup) - race home
**6pm**: Feed baby when home

That's ~90 minutes of your workday just... not working. Not to mention the mental load of scheduling it around meetings.

## The Logistical Nightmare

**Finding a space**: I was lucky—my office had a first aid room with a sink and a microwave that no one seemed to use.

**Scheduling around meetings**: "Sorry, can we move the 2pm? That's my pump time." Or just keep your camera off and repeat "Sorry about that background noise, it's just my heavy industrial sized breast pump".

**Storing milk**: Our office fridge was helpful, but the number of times I forgot to take the milk I painstakingly pumped home was embarrassing. I occasionally did the 3 hour round trip back in to work on Fridays just to pick up my milk so it wouldn't get thrown out.

## What Made It Easier

**Block it on calendar**: I blocked "Personal" time. That way people don't book over my pumping times when I am fiddling with the 26 part machine and trying to remember how it all fits together.

**Having backup supplies**: Extra pump parts at work saved me multiple times.

**Work flexible**: I wasn't as productive during those work hours, sure. But I often made up for it in the 8-10pm shift once baby was in bed.

## Why This Matters

About 80% of new mums start breastfeeding. Many want to continue when they return to work. But the lack of support means many stop earlier than they wanted.

We talk about diversity in tech. We talk about retention of women. But if we don't support the practical realities of being a working mum, we're going to keep losing talented women from the industry.

## To Other Pumping Mums

Block that time. Don't apologize for it. Your body is doing something amazing.

If someone makes you feel bad about it, that's their problem, not yours.

And if you decide to stop? That's okay too. Fed is best, your mental health matters.

## To Everyone Else

If a colleague says they need to pump, just say "of course" and move on. Don't make it weird.

If you're in leadership, push for better lactation facilities.

If you're in a meeting and someone says they need to step out, don't make them explain why.

We normalize coffee breaks. We can normalize feeding breaks too.
