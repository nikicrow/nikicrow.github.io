# Principal 3: Balancing hands on teaching vs letting independence grow

First, let us dive into each of these and why they are important independently.

## 3.1 Teaching others

Teaching others is very hard.

When I was in late high school and university, I was a tutor mainly doing math and science for year 11 and 12. It is so hard because you need to put yourself into somebody elses mind and see how they think and relate a concept you understand to them so that they can understand it.

How exhausting to spend time understanding how someone else looks at the world.

It might be slow and painful at first, but if you don't try and actively teach other people how, they will be less efficient at learning. If you are not teaching them in a way that makes sense to them, you are slowing down progress for them and yourself.

That initial time investment to teach them basic things like where to get more information for example, will pay itself back very quickly in time gained for you.

**This comes with a caveat:** by investing too much time in teaching a person, you are sacrificing time in other areas, and also sacrificing an opportunity for them to learn something independently. This leads us to the next point.

## 3.2 Letting independence grow

I think my dad sums up this point the best. He says:

> "The goal of parenting is to make the kids independent of the parents."

We all know that by letting kids 'learn the hard way', the lesson is better consolidated in their minds.

How many times have I told Ember to stop standing on the chair because she may fall and hurt herself? It feels like a waste of breath. If I let her fall, hurt herself, and learn that we should indeed not stand on the chair as that increases her potential energy (and therefore potential fall damage), then she would stop doing it.

But, that involves her being hurt which I also can't bear, and so I continue to scold her for standing on the chair.

### Applied in a work setting

We loosen the leash on those we delegate tasks to, and let them work at something, come up with a somewhat questionable solution, ensure that it isn't going to be catastrophic if it fails, and then we merge it and watch it sometimes inevitably fail.

The coder, being given independence and ownership of this task, feels responsible for the failure, and steps up with a keen and urgent sense of figuring out what was wrong and how they can prevent this occurring in the future.

We could have stepped in before merging and said 'Have you thought about ...?' and in fact, I think we should (and I do) but the point of independence is to say:

> "You own it, if you break it, you fix it, I want you to grow in your independence as a developer and learn faster - the hard way."

## 3.3 The balance

Teaching others vs letting independence grow are diametrically opposed. By being hands on and teaching them how to do something, you are taking away their opportunity to teach themselves.

The thing I believe that truly scales is finding the right balance for the individual who is reporting to you.

### How do you know what the right balance is for that individual?

Well, I don't know what the equation is, but I can list some of the variables that I believe I have observed:

1. **Desire for independence** - Some people want to be spoon fed and want their hands held the whole time. Some people want nothing to do with your opinion on how to approach a task and will simply rebel if you attempt to get alongside them.

2. **Their propensity to efficiently learn and teach themselves**

3. **The nature/complexity of the task** and their experience level in tasks of that nature.

4. **Their need for constant recognition and validation** to know they are headed the right way.

So like for me, I would say I have a high propensity to learn and teach myself, but the nature/complexity of the task and my experience at that kind of task will really determine how much advice I feel like I need before I am ready to tackle the task. I don't really enjoy being mansplained at and I don't really care for constant recognition and validation as I am a bit too cocky to require that.

## A Caveat: AI

So with using AI to do tasks for you, you should probably not worry about its 'independence' at all.

How good it is at a task is unlikely to change much from you teaching it, unless you have a spare few million dollars in compute or infrastructure to train LLMs yourself.

Clearer instructions will absolutely make a big difference, but that is more like being hands on with explaining what you expect. Be super clear and don't spare detail and ask for creativity if you have a strong view on how something should work.

This is a natural segway into the next section.
